# Aircraft simulation program in Java | avaj-launcher

Aircraft Simulation Program written in Java language. The Scenario file specifies how many different weather conditions will be triggered first. Up to this number, the updateWeather function is triggered and the new weather is transmitted by the tower to the registered aircraft. The aircraft's updateConditions function is used to transmit. Aircraft are updating their coordinates for 4 different weather conditions. Aircraft can only ascend in sunny weather conditions and reach a maximum height of 100. In other weather conditions, their heights decrease and when they go below 0, they write a landing message.
